This will certainly help to learn, explore and of course have fun with Electronics. But most people don’t know how to set up a lab. There are lot of questions to answer – How much space I need? What are the tools I should buy? How much it will cost? To help answering these questions i have prepared this guide to setup a Electronics lab at home. I hope this will be helpful for all budding Electronic Engineers and Hobbyist.</p><h3 id=workspace>Workspace</h3><p>This is the first thing you need to set up for your lab. The workspace should consist a large wooden work bench, desk or table that should have ample amount of space for you to work with. While the size of the bench is subjective. Choose a size that will hold the components and tools while you are working. Ensure that work area is well lit and comfortable to work with even for a long time. Your workspace should be accessible to household electrical power socket.</p><p>Also install a Desktop or Laptop computer in your workspace which will be really helpful in referring to datasheets of components or IC’s. Also it will come handy when you are working with Microcontrollers to program and test them.</p><div class=click-zoom><label><input type=checkbox>
