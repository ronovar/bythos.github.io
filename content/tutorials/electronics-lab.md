#### How To Set Up One?

{{< image-gallery >}}

Every electronic hobbyist have a dream of setting up a lab at home. This will certainly help to learn, explore and of course have fun with Electronics. But most people don’t know how to set up a lab. There are lot of questions to answer – How much space I need? What are the tools I should buy? How much it will cost? To help answering these questions i have prepared this guide to setup a Electronics lab at home. I hope this will be helpful for all budding Electronic Engineers and Hobbyist.

### Workspace

This is the first thing you need to set up for your lab. The workspace should consist a large wooden work bench, desk or table that should have ample amount of space for you to work with. While the size of the bench is subjective. Choose a size that will hold the components and tools while you are working. Ensure that work area is well lit and comfortable to work with even for a long time. Your workspace should be accessible to household electrical power socket.

Also install a Desktop or Laptop computer in your workspace which will be really helpful in referring to datasheets of components or IC’s. Also it will come handy when you are working with Microcontrollers to program and test them.

### Equipments To Buy

These are some of the important tools and equipment that you should consider buying. The list is sorted to show the most important tool least important one. This list is subjective and the priority can vary based on project you likely to work with. This is intend to give some idea about the tools.

### UNI-T UT61+ Digital Multimeter - US $89.99

{{< click-zoom src="/bythos.github.io/images/electronics-lab-uni-t-ut61+.png#center" height="100%" width="100%" >}}

UT61+ series are reliable true RMS digital multimeters with 22,000 display counts (UT61E+). It can measure up to 1000V AC/DC.

Equipped with audible and visible alarm, this series can provide warning expecially when measuring high voltage/current and temperature.
For the our lab circuit we use two multimeters, one to measure the voltage and another one to measure the current. So we need to buy two same models of multimeters.

### AIXUN T245 Solder Station - US $153,90
