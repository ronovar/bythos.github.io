### Workspace

This is the first thing you need to set up for your lab. The workspace should consist a large wooden work bench, desk or table that should have ample amount of space for you to work with.

Ensure that work area is well lit and comfortable to work with even for a long time. Your workspace should be accessible to household electrical power socket.
